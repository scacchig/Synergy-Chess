# Synergy-Chess

Synergy-Chess is the public project of "py-goratschin" (https://github.com/feldi/py-goratschin#py-goratschin) which I have modified to allow 8 chess engines to run at the same time, instead of 2.

Synergy-Chess is a "chess engine" that supports the UCI chess protocol and combines 8 chess engines into one. In the goratschinChess.py file, the names of the 8 chess engines are : boss, counselor, counselor2, counselor3, counselor4, counselor5 and counselor6, counselor7

Synergy-Chess includes 8 .exe files which correspond to 8 different versions of Stockfish 15 Development (https://abrok.eu/stockfish); in Synergy-Chess each Stockfish 15 file is connected with a different NNUE network which passed the fishtest tests and reached the default network status during Stockfish development (https://tests.stockfishchess.org/nns) .; the rest of the configuration relating to the 8 Stockfih 15 files is the same for all, but it is also possible to customize them.

Synergy-Chess selects the "best move" to send to the GUI with the majority system of 7 chess engines. In case of a tie if a group of chess engines has the same move as the chess engine number 8 (counselor7), Synergy-Chess chooses that move, but if not, the system rewards the group with the highest positional score, finally, if all chess engines express a different opinion, in this case we choose the move of the chess engine number 8 (counselor7).


# Decision-making system by majority and score #

# Note: chess engine = CE

Synegy-Chess chooses the Best Move to be sent to the GUI with 9 different criteria :

cr1) - Check absolute majority between 7 chess engines in the following chronological order ; 

majority 7 equal moves, 6 equal moves, 5 equal moves, 4 equal moves, and the first that is True is the Best Move

Absolute Majority between 7 chess engines is always the "Priority Criterion" ;

if between 7 CE there is no absolute majority of 7, 6, 5 or 4 equal moves, we move on to the next verification - cr 2)


cr2) - Check if between 7 CE there is a group of 3 CE with equal moves and compare with the verdict of the CE n 째 8 ;

if a group of 3 CE has the same move as CE n 째 8, this is the Best Move, but if not, proceed to the next check - cr3) 


cr3) - if between 7 CE 3 CE agree and 3 CE agree but with a different move from first group. in this case the Best Move is :

score move CE / 1 - score move CE / 2 

if diff > = 0 : best move = move CE / 1 

if diff < 0 : best move = move CE / 2


cr4) if between 7 CE there is an absolute majority of 3 CE with equal moves and if is True this is Best Move, but if not, proceed to the next check - cr5)


cr5) - Check if between 7 CE there is a group of 2 CE with equal moves and compare with the verdict of the CE n 째 8 ;

if a group of 2 CE has the same move as CE n 째 8, this is the Best Move, but if not, proceed to the next check - cr6)


cr6) - if between 7 CE 3 groups of 2 CE agree but each group has a different move, the Best Move is :

score move CE / 1 - score move CE / 2

score move CE / 1 - score move CE / 3

score move CE / 2 - score move CE / 3

if score move CE / 1 - score move CE / 2 >= 0 and score move CE / 1 - score move CE / 3 >= 0 : best move = move CE / 1

if score move CE / 1 - score move CE / 2 >= 0 and score move CE / 1 - score move CE / 3 < 0 : best move = move CE / 3

if score move CE / 1 - score move CE / 2 < 0 and score move CE / 2 - score move CE / 3 >= 0 : best move = move CE / 2

if score move CE / 1 - score move CE / 2 < 0 and score move CE / 2 - score move CE / 3 < 0 : best move = move CE / 3



cr7) -  if between 7 CE 2 CE agree and 2 CE agree but with a different move :

score move CE / 1 - score move CE / 2

if diff >= 0 : best move = move CE / 1

if diff < 0 : best move = move CE / 2


cr8)  if between 7 CE there is an absolute majority of 2 CE with equal moves and if is True this is Bst Move, but if not, proceed to the next check - cr9)


cr9) -  the CE all give different moves : best move = move of chess engine number 8





# CONSIDERATIONS 
Synergy-Chess is suitable for games ranging from 40 minutes upwards and the system should bring a slight increase in the ELO score of the chosen chess engine, in short, the inspiration and variety of analysis induced by the 7 different NNUE networks should prevail, and if you have a latest generation CPU, the advantages of the system also increase.

It is true that the single opponent chess engine analyzes more in depth because the multiple chess engine is obliged to divide the processing power of the CPU among the 8 chess engines, however it seems that such depth of analysis is sufficiently qualitative and reliable because the choice of Best Move derives from the comparison of a considerable number of chess engines, moreover the depth of analysis is not always essential.

At the moment there is no chess GUI that allows you to create and configure a group of chess engines that work in synergy like Synergy-Chess, so it would be interesting if some chess GUI implemented such a system to simplify its use and make it accessible even to who do not has familiar with Python


# System Requirements

1 - Python 3 or later installed on your PC (https://www.python.org/downloads)

2 - approximately - 850/900 MB of hard disk space

3 - GUI Arena 3.5.1 (http://www.playwitharena.de)

4 - Windows 10 operating system

5 - a little patience to fix everything.....


# Synergy-Chess installation instructions

.1 - Install GUI Arena 3.5.1 on your PC
http://www.playwitharena.de

.2 - Install Python 3.9 or 3.10 on your PC
https://www.python.org/downloads

.3 - create a single directory where all necessary files will be placed.


.4 - in the directory created insert all the files necessary for the correct functioning of Synergy-Chess ; for reasons of web space on github I uploaded all the necessary files to Google Drive at this address - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A5Mrn6CqueTQnUElgdrXBzpMw1jYl0c8/view?usp=sharing -

List of files zipped in RAR file :

a) - 8 different .exe files of the latest development versions of Stockfish 15

b) - 8 different NNUE networks that passed fishtest testing and achieved the status of default net during the development of Stockfish.

c) - 1 goratschinLauncher.txt file, 1 goratschinLauncher.py file and 1 goratschinChess.py file


.5 - open the goratschinLuncher.txt file and replace the first path with the path where the Python.exe file is located on your PC, then replace the second path with the path of the single directory you created on your PC; now, save the file in the directory you created by typing gotatschinLauncher.bat in the File Name field; this .bat file will be installed as a chess engine in the GUI of Arena 3.5.1

.6 - open the goratschinLuncher.py file and in engineFolderDefault replace the existing path with the path where the single directory you created is located; the names in engineFileNames must be left unchanged; then further down, still in the same file, go to the options line and change the 8 identical paths of SyzygyPath (tablesas) with the path where the  tablesas is located on your PC; possibly you can download the Syzygy endings table here - https://chess.massimilianogoi.com/download/tablebases - we recommend the download of Syzygy table bases 3-4-5 pieces that take up only 1 GB of hard disk space; the other values should not be changed, unless you know what you are doing ...; finally, now you can save the file with the same name and extension .py always in the directory you created.

.7 - last step: open the GUI Arena 3.5.1 and install the goratschinLauncher.bat file as a new chess engine and then on the Engine menu, Manage enable the UCI function and not Autodetecd. If you don't see the .bat file, just enable viewing of all files.

.8 - Have fun with Synergy-Chess
