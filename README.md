# Synergy-Chess

Synergy-Chess is the public project of "py-goratschin" (https://github.com/feldi/py-goratschin#py-goratschin) which I have modified to allow 8 chess engines to run at the same time, instead of 2.

Synergy-Chess is a "chess engine" that supports the UCI chess protocol and combines 8 chess engines into one. In the goratschinChess.py file the names of the 8 chess engines are : boss, counselor, counselor2, counselor3, counselor4, counselor5 and counselor6, counselor7.   Each chess engine is connected to its default NNUE network and has an ELO score above 3400 (March 31, 2022)

Synergy-Chess selects the "best move" to send to the GUI with the majority system of 7 chess engines. In case of a tie if a group of chess engines has the same move as the chess engine number 8 (counselor7), Synergy-Chess chooses that move, but if not, the system rewards the group with the highest positional score, finally, if all chess engines express a different opinion, in this case we choose the move of the chess engine number 8 (counselor7).


# Decision-making system by majority and score #

# Note: chess engine = CE

Synegy-Chess chooses the Best Move to be sent to the GUI with 9 different criteria :

cr1) - Check absolute majority between 7 chess engines in the following chronological order ; 

majority 7 equal moves, 6 equal moves, 5 equal moves, 4 equal moves, and the first that is True is the Best Move

Absolute Majority between 7 chess engines is always the "Priority Criterion" ;

if between 7 CE there is no absolute majority of 7, 6, 5 or 4 equal moves, we move on to the next verification - cr 2)


cr2) - Check if between 7 CE there is a group of 3 CE with equal moves and compare with the verdict of the CE n 째 8 ;

if a group of 3 CE has the same move as CE n 째 8, this is the Best Move, but if not, proceed to the next check - cr3) 


cr3) - if between 7 CE 3 CE agree and 3 CE agree but with a different move from first group. in this case the Best Move is :

score move CE / 1 - score move CE / 2 

if diff > = 0 : best move = move CE / 1 

if diff < 0 : best move = move CE / 2


cr4) if between 7 CE there is an absolute majority of 3 CE with equal moves and if is True this is Best Move, but if not, proceed to the next check - cr5)


cr5) - Check if between 7 CE there is a group of 2 CE with equal moves and compare with the verdict of the CE n 째 8 ;

if a group of 2 CE has the same move as CE n 째 8, this is the Best Move, but if not, proceed to the next check - cr6)


cr6) - if between 7 CE 3 groups of 2 CE agree but each group has a different move, the Best Move is :

score move CE / 1 - score move CE / 2

score move CE / 1 - score move CE / 3

score move CE / 2 - score move CE / 3

if score move CE / 1 - score move CE / 2 >= 0 and score move CE / 1 - score move CE / 3 >= 0 : best move = move CE / 1

if score move CE / 1 - score move CE / 2 >= 0 and score move CE / 1 - score move CE / 3 < 0 : best move = move CE / 3

if score move CE / 1 - score move CE / 2 < 0 and score move CE / 2 - score move CE / 3 >= 0 : best move = move CE / 2

if score move CE / 1 - score move CE / 2 < 0 and score move CE / 2 - score move CE / 3 < 0 : best move = move CE / 3



cr7) -  if between 7 CE 2 CE agree and 2 CE agree but with a different move :

score move CE / 1 - score move CE / 2

if diff >= 0 : best move = move CE / 1

if diff < 0 : best move = move CE / 2


cr8)  if between 7 CE there is an absolute majority of 2 CE with equal moves and if is True this is Bst Move, but if not, proceed to the next check - cr9)


cr9) -  the CE all give different moves : best move = move of chess engine number 8





# CONSIDERATIONS 
Synergy-Chess is suitable for games ranging from 40 minutes upwards and the system should bring a slight increase in the ELO score of the chosen chess engine, in short, the inspiration and variety of analysis induced by the 8 different NNUE networks should prevail, and if you have a latest generation CPU, the advantages of the system also increase.

It is true that the single opponent chess engine analyzes more in depth because the multiple chess engine is obliged to divide the processing power of the CPU among the 8 chess engines, however it seems that such depth of analysis is sufficiently qualitative and reliable because the choice of Best Move derives from the comparison of a considerable number of chess engines, moreover the depth of analysis is not always essential.

At the moment there is no chess GUI that allows you to create and configure a group of chess engines that work in synergy like Synergy-Chess, so it would be interesting if some chess GUI implemented such a system to simplify its use and make it accessible even to who do not has familiar with Python


# System Requirements

1 - Python 3 or later installed on your PC (https://www.python.org/downloads)

2 - approximately - 850/900 MB of hard disk space

3 - GUI Arena 3.5.1 (http://www.playwitharena.de)

4 - Windows 10 operating system

5 - a little patience to fix everything.....


# Synergy-Chess installation instructions

.1 - Install GUI Arena 3.5.1 on your PC
http://www.playwitharena.de

.2 - Install Python 3.9 or 3.10 on your PC
https://www.python.org/downloads

.3 - create a single directory where all necessary files will be placed.


.4 - in the directory created insert all the files necessary for the correct functioning of Synergy-Chess ; for reasons of web space on github I uploaded all the necessary files to Google Drive at this address - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pKH9MByNX8WMHYZ6XHys6CGT6YAL3EoF/view?usp=sharing -

List of files zipped in RAR file SynergyChess.rar (Chess Engines executable files that run on all CPUs) :

a) - 8 .exe files related to the 8 chess engines

b) - 3 files NNUE networks

c) - 1 goratschinLauncher.txt file, 1 goratschinLauncher.py file and 1 goratschinChess.py file

d) - if you have a CPU that supports BMI2 or AVX2 architecture you can replace the 8 chess engines with BMI2 or AVX2 executables, but you must check the default NNUE network of each chess engine you enter and, if necessary, replace 1 or more NNUE networks that you downloaded from Synergy-Chess, also, you need to rename the executables you add: SFa1, SFa2, SFa3, SFa4, SFa5, SFa6, SFa7, SFa8.


.5 - open the goratschinLuncher.txt file and replace the first path with the path where the Python.exe file is located on your PC, then replace the second path with the path of the single directory you created on your PC; now, save the file in the directory you created by typing gotatschinLauncher.bat in the File Name field; this .bat file will be installed as a chess engine in the GUI of Arena 3.5.1

.6 - open the goratschinLauncher.py file and in engineFolderDefault replace the existing path with the path where the single directory you created is located and save file ; the names in engineFileNames must be left unchanged.

.7 - last step: open the GUI Arena 3.5.1 and from the Engine Menu install the goratschinLauncher.bat file as a new chess engine (if you don't see the .bat file, enable the display of all files) and then from the Engine / Manage menu enable the UCI function and not Autodetecd, and we recommend enabling arena books ; finally, from the Engine Engine 1 menu (or right mouse button under the chessboard) click on configure and search "SyzygyPath" and enter the path where the endgames table is located on your PC; possibly you can download the Syzygy endings table here - https://chess.massimilianogoi.com/download/tablebases - we recommend the download of Syzygy 3-4-5 pieces table bases that take up only 1 GB of hard disk space ; the other values should not be changed, unless you know what you are doing...

.8 - Have fun with Synergy-Chess
